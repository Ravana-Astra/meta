# Scenarios

> :construction: TK-TODO

The following scenarios present slightly different campaigns, each of which can be played and explored using the provided tools. Each scenario is designed to focus on a slightly different aspect of arp cache poisoning attacks, contextualized by their degree of efficacy under certain circumstances.

## Scenario 1: "I, Spy"


#### Roles & Tools

In this scenario, these are the tools that must be used by each of the relevant roles. Decide which role you and your teammate(s) will choose and delegate the appropriate tools, or else just play both parts yourself!

**Comrades:** Red desktop (offense)

**Narc:** Blue desktop (defense)

#### The scenario

### Offense

You and your comrades have recently discovered that a local café is a favorite haunt of a known narc. Suspecting that he may be doing his tattling from this very café, you visit the spot (taking turns between people, so as not to become conspicuous) staking out the place until you nail down his schedule. You decide you want to get more information about what this guy's been up to, but to do it in such a way that he probably won't notice.

You've recently learning about ARP cache poisoning, and have decided to use the `ettercap` tool to quietly gather information on the dude and spy on his browser window.

Proceed with this campaign: ["I, Spy"](https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/tree/master/train-the-trainers/black-hat-bash-back/arp-cache-poisoning/Red%20Team#i-spy)
